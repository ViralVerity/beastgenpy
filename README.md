# beastgenpy

A python package to make complicated XMLs for BEASTv1.10

Broadly speaking it's to help with ones that can be difficult to make in BEAUti or aren'tt available yet eg:

1. Discrete trait analysis with GLM
2. Continuous trait analysis
3. Multi-tree analyses
4. Fixed trees

And combinations of the above
